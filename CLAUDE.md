## Coding Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase, one component per file
- **Pages:** `page.tsx` inside app directory folders
- **Blog posts:** kebab-case MDX filenames, frontmatter required (title, date, category, description)
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- **Branches:** `feature/`, `fix/`, `content/`, `docs/` prefixes
- **No hardcoded content** — all services data, navigation, and metadata in config files

---

## ADR Convention

Architecture Decision Records live in `docs/adr/`.
Naming: `NNN-short-description.md`
Each ADR has: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.
Write an ADR for every significant technology or architectural choice.

## What NOT to Put in This Repo

- Pricing details (rates, packages, discounts) — keep in a private repo
- Client data (names, contact info, engagement notes) — keep in a private repo
- Blog drafts (unpublished posts) — keep in a private repo until published
- Business/legal documents (contracts, invoices, GST filings) — keep in a private repo

## Mandatory: After Each Unit of Work

After completing any unit of work (feature, file change, milestone, key decision):

1. **AI-REFERENCE.md** — update if any files or folders were added, moved, or deleted
2. **AI-SUMMARY.md** — add an entry under "Recent Completions": `- [YYYY-MM-DD] <what was done>`; update phase status when a milestone is reached
3. **docs/adr/** — write an ADR for every significant technology or architectural decision
